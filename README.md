# Database-UTS
-- This database is created by the working process of the Asian food distribution company names "super food service" (made-up name). 
-- The entity-relationship is similar to the company I worked, but the record is not actual data.
-- The product names refer to this website: https://bestfoodservice.com.au/home.

-- How database application works 
-- The process starts with restaurants ordering the products that come from the warehouse.
-- When the staff finishes picking up the products in each order, the order will get together in one run. 
-- Run means ways to deliver products to restaurants that can be more than one restaurant.
-- The driver and sales staff are assigned to check and deliver the product in their runs.
-- The delivery can go more than one run if some runs are near.
-- The truck can have more than one person, but in practice, salestaffs do not go to deliver products with drivers.
-- This company is a family business, so they do not have many trucks, but different sizes depending on how many orders are in a day.
-- The supplier will come to fill products if any product is in shortage.
